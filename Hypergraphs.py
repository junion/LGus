        # Graham's algorithm is as follows:
        # Apply the following two operations until neither applies:
        # 1. Delete a vertex that it is in only one hyperedge
        # 2. Delete a redundant hyperedge
        # If the hypergraph is decomposable all vertices will eventually be deleted.

        # Beeri et al show that Graham's algorithm can be used to construct
        # a join tree from a decomposable hypergraph. The vertices of the join tree are the
        # hyperedges of the hypergraph. If a non-empty hyperedge is deleted at step 2 of Graham's algorithm
        # then, in the join tree, an edge is drawn between it and one of the hyperedges containing it.

        # This method implements this approach. The only difference from Graham's algorithm
        # is that in step 1 all 'isolated' vertices in the selected hyperedge are removed. Only
        # once this is done is there any prospect of the hyperedge being redundant.

        # Since hyperedges will be altered we set up 'state' (lines 1-3) which maps hyperedges
        # from their (immutable) initial state to their
        # (mutable) current state. If a hyperedge is deleted it is removed from 'state'.
        # In lines 4-11 is set up the mapping 'in_only_one'. A hyperedge is a key in this mapping if it
        # contains a vertex which appears in no other edges (an 'isolated' vertex).
        # The value associated with this key is
        # just the set of vertices only appearing in the hyperedge. If a vertex appears in more than one
        # hyperedge, we record how many in the mapping 'cardinality'.

        # The join forest is initialised to have the hyperedges as vertices, and no edges at line 12.

        # The main loop is executed as long as there is a vertex contained in only one edge (line 13).

        # A hyperedge containing vertices not found elsewhere is selected and these vertices are
        # then deleted from it (lines 14-16). If residual vertices exist in the hyperedge (line 17), we
        # need to check for redundancy. Lines 18-25 do this by constructing 'proper_supersets': the set of
        # remaining (line 21) hyperedges containing all vertices in 'residue'.
        # If (line 26) this is non-empty, then the hyperedge is removed (line 27) and an arbitrary
        # member of proper_supersets is chosen for the required connection in the join tree (line 28).
        # If a hyperedge has been removed it is necessary to update 'in_only_one'
        # and 'cardinality' appropriately (lines 30-35).

        # Lines 36,37: If there were no residual vertices then the hyperedge has become empty.
        # So, if there are
        # any other remaining hyperedges, it will be redundant, but no join forest edges need be drawn.
